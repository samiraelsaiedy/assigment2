"This maybe hit the cinemas a month too early as there's a distinctly festive feel to this latest outing for the menacing ""Art"" the clown. He descends upon the townsfolk with blood-thirsty enthusiasm causing some brutal carnage but then he and his equally heinous pal ""Vicky"" (Samantha Scaffidi) go for a long nap. It's a pair of unfortunate demolition guys who provide their wake up entertainment and rejuvenated, they set out in search of ""Sienna"" (Lauren LaVera) and brother ""Jonathan"" (Elliott Fulham) - and woe betides anyone who gets in the way - even if you are dressed as Santa Claus. This is by far the best of the three so far, I think. There's much less repetition with the standard slashing-fayre and a bit more, dare I say, intimacy from our ""Terrifier"" as David Howard Thornton imbues his character with more akin to an emotional and quirky mime artist. There's more sadness, mischief and playfulness as he wields everything from an axe to a chain-saw. Shower sex might never be the same again! It's really the last half hour that gets it moving and though that scenario is largely predictable and I have to say that none of the speaking-part acting here is really very good, the tension mounts nicely and there's an entertaining degree of shock mixed with dark humour and Christmas gifts to raise a smile and maybe the one hair on the back of your neck towards the denouement. Sure, it's formulaic and there aren't so many surprises, but they are getting better and moving away from the Hammer style of ketchup gore and annoying, hysterical, frat-style characters that we've seen before. It's entirely forgettable, and far too long, but I did quite enjoy it.",5,2024-10-14T05:01:31.886Z,CinemaSerf,unknown,1034541,Terrifier 3,movie
"Just as violent, just not as entertaining.

It's better than <em>'Terrifier'</em>, though falls slightly below <em>'Terrifier 2'</em>. <em>'Terrifier 3'</em> is thankfully a little shorter than the prior installment, though the story isn't quite as watchable as before. It does have some good moments though, while Lauren LaVera and David Howard Thornton again bring strong onscreen showings.",6,2024-10-25T09:27:10.151Z,r96sk,unknown,1034541,Terrifier 3,movie
"A solid enough send off for this <em>'Venom'</em> trilogy.

<em>'Venom: The Last Dance'</em> is decently amusing and produces enough entertainment with its plot. I didn't personally find it overly funny, though the person a few seats across from me had an absolute blast - never a bad thing seeing people enjoy themselves!

Tom Hardy remains the key element of these films, they would be far less enjoyable without his presence. There's a nice montage of sorts towards the end, it admittedly didn't 'hit' all that much for me but I imagine it's effective for proper fans of the series. Rhys Ifans and Chiwetel Ejiofor stick out most from the other characters.",6,2024-10-25T18:25:18.286Z,r96sk,unknown,912649,Venom: The Last Dance,movie
"The other two at the very least were enjoyable. This one, not so much.

The villian is forced, the movie feels so chopped up, there's no threat because the creatures and Eddie both just heal each other. It had bad dialogue for some scenes, and a weird sub plot about shoes.

Oh, and also, one of Eddie's flashbacks he wasn't even there for.",4,2024-10-27T14:01:38.601Z,Mangoturtle,unknown,912649,Venom: The Last Dance,movie
"Perhaps this was just one sequel too many as the story here is really rather thin, but there's still enough chemistry between ""Eddie"" (Tom Hardy) and his eponymous symbion to raise a smile or two. This time it's not just the pursuing human population that's a problem for them, but there are creatures from the homeworld of ""Venom"" homing in on their unique ""codex"" so that they can help free their leader from incarceration to wreak havoc on the universe. Along the way, they encounter the hippie ""Martin"" (Rhys Ifans) and his family and cadge a lift in their VW camper-van whilst offering a fairly tuneless rendition of some David Bowie. It all builds up to a fairly predictable denouement with humanity facing some tough choices, the seemingly indestructible aliens on the verge of success and our intrepid partnership having to consider the ultimate sacrifice. Yep, we've seen it all before and though the visual effects are pretty impressive, that's not really enough to sustain it as it rather procedurally rolls along. There is occasionally some wit in the script and Hardy looks like he's having fun, but Chiwetel Ejiofor is largely under-used and it relies far too heavily on repetitive combat scenes to really make it stand out amidst the surfeit of 2024 comic-book derivatives. It's all watchable enough, but it's not a patch on the first one from 2018.",6,2024-10-31T11:02:06.190Z,CinemaSerf,unknown,912649,Venom: The Last Dance,movie
"There are times in our lives when nearly all of us exceed the limits of our capabilities (and often quite unexpectedly at that). But that can be a tremendous blessing, especially when we’re confronted by circumstances where such aptitudes are called for. So it is for Roz (Lupita Nyong’o), a robot who inadvertently ends up stranded on a remote island when the vessel transporting her crashes without warning. Roz isn’t alone, though; she finds herself surrounded by a diverse array of forest animals who, curious though they might be, don’t quite know what to make of the mysterious metallic stranger. Meanwhile, the somewhat bewildered new arrival is out of her anticipated element, too, expecting to be in the company of humans for whom she’s been programmed to function as a domestic servant. However, the fundamental disconnect between these parties gradually dissipates as they each get to know one another, particularly when Roz needs to grow beyond her innate programming to overcome a series of challenges and bond with her new organic familiars, most notably a young goose (Kit Connor) whom she’s charged with raising when the gosling’s parents are accidently killed. Before long, Roz develops a sentience that helps her evolve beyond a collection of circuits and microchips, a development that proves valuable in a world beset by even bigger issues. In his latest animated feature outing, writer-director Chris Sanders has created a thoughtful, entertaining tale with an uplifting message we can all draw upon when life ups the ante on us. The picture’s stunningly gorgeous animation, solid writing, and delightfully amusing voiceover performances by the likes of Nyong’o and co-stars Pedro Pascal, Bill Nighy, Mark Hamill, Catherine O’Hara, Ving Rhames and Stephanie Hsu collectively deliver a fine mix of hearty laughs, inspiring insights and touching moments, all without becoming silly or saccharine. Admittedly, the film has a little trouble finding its footing at the outset, and a few story threads feel a little underdeveloped, such as subplots related to important but underexplained environmental themes. What’s more, it can be somewhat mystifying at times trying to figure out exactly who this offering was made for, as the material often comes across as a little more mature and decidedly more intense than what one might expect for younger viewers (despite its adorable depictions of its funny, furry forest creatures). However, these modest shortcomings are more than made up for the further one gets into the story, growing progressively stronger as the narrative unfolds. Most importantly, though, it’s gratifying to see a production that genuinely rises above the low bar that has been set for many releases in this genre these days. “The Wild Robot” is one of those films that’s sure to please a wide range of moviegoers, including those who generally aren’t particularly enamored with animation. It’s a feel-good movie that doesn’t resort to wearing that trait on its sleeve – but that nevertheless achieves such an admirably heartwarming effect anyways.",6,2024-10-09T13:27:16.982Z,Brent Marchant,unknown,1184918,The Wild Robot,movie
"Brimming with thoughtful themes and stunning artwork, The Wild Robot is a deeply meaningful new touchstone in animated film.

Of course, animation has “heroed” nature before – see The Lion King, WALL-E and basically the entire output of Studio Ghibli. But there’s two core elements to The Wild Robot that set this film apart from the rest. The first is its gorgeous, painterly style.

The second? The film’s deeply human themes, encompassing everything from the meaning of motherhood and the lasting legacy of adoption, to our worship of technological advancement and our fraught relationship with the natural world. Like we said – The Wild Robot is nothing if not surprising.

"""Roz"" is pre-programmed to help. Whatever it is that needs doing, it is there to make it happen - even when it is wrecked on an island populated by animals whose main desire in life is to eat each other. At least the arrival of the ""monster"" manages to galvanise them into one brief moment of hostile unanimity and so when they are not trying to cannibalise it, they are shunning it's efforts to be friends. After spending a year learning their various languages, there follows a calamitous escapade with a nest, a chase with an hungry fox (""Fink"") and the creation of the most unlikely of family units charged with rearing a particularly timid little gosling whom they name ""Brightbill"". The scene is now set for some entertaining adventures as ""Roz"" has to teach her new-found charge how to eat, to swim and then ultimately to fly away so as to avoid the harsh winter. Each of those tasks comes with it's own hazards but maybe, just maybe, our little team can manage to get project ""Brightbill"" off the ground? No, of course there's no jeopardy here at all, and at times it's comes across as an amalgam of ""Wall:E"" (2008) with some Hans Christian Anderson thrown in for good measure. That's no bad thing, though, as the characterisation of the android is personable and develops amiably as his programming starts to evolve into something far more akin to a soul than a brain. It does tackle some more serious subjects - loneliness, rejection, isolation and issues with self-esteem to name a few, but always in fashion that illustrates a point then offers some sort of optimism that a solution can be found for even the most difficult challenges. The standard of animation is engagingly natural and it's genuinely quite funny with some of the observations, especially from the fox, working well within the framework of a touching story that extols the values of caring, teamwork and even a little forgiveness, without becoming gloopy or dialogue-heavy. It looks great on a big screen and is well worth a gander...!",6,2024-10-20T16:54:44.216Z,CinemaSerf,unknown,1184918,The Wild Robot,movie

""The Wild Robot offers much more than just immersive visuals, inspirational music, and diverse moments of pure entertainment - it's a deeply reflective story that tackles complex, relevant themes with a delicate balance of heart and humor. Through the robotic protagonist's journey of self-discovery, Chris Sanders explores the intersection of technology and nature, touching on topics like identity, empathy, and community, among others.

This thematic depth, combined with astonishing animation and an exceptional voice cast, makes Roz's adventure not only one of the most remarkable movies of the year but also an impactful study of coexistence, adaptation, and what it truly means to live in harmony with the world around us.""

"The Substance delivers an intense, visually mesmerizing commentary on the entertainment industry's obsession with youth and outward beauty. Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley offer remarkable, maybe even career-best performances, with Dennis Quaid excelling in his role as well. Coralie Fargeat explores how aging stars, particularly women, are discarded when they no longer meet the industry's strict beauty standards. Moore's character, haunted by the memory of her former fame and beauty, goes down a dark path in pursuit of a ""better"" version of herself. The story is also a sharp critique of power dynamics, with white men controlling who's in front of the spotlight, while women are pitted against one another for validation.

The film's production is equally impressive, especially the makeup and prosthetic work that elevates its body horror elements. While the first half of the movie is more subdued, the gore ramps up significantly as the plot unfolds, culminating in a chaotic ""fourth act"" that will leave audiences bewildered. The fast-paced editing, paired with an impactful score, heightens the tension and surrealism of the narrative. Though there's a part of me who prefers a version of the film that ends before the wild final act, the overall experience is an unforgettable, audacious exploration of vanity, control, and desperation in the entertainment world.

"For a film that’s laser-focused on the human body, it’s gloriously on point that THE SUBSTANCE begins with a freshly cracked, bright yellow egg yolk. 

Eggs are the ‘giver of life’, right? They’re the origin of all of us. Gleaming and plump, the yolk suddenly gets pricked – not by a fork, but a syringe.

That’s the first juicy visual metaphor of many in this meaningfully bonkers body horror, for which French filmmaker Coralie Fargeat picked up the prestigious Best Screenplay prize at this year’s Cannes Film Festival.

To call the film ‘bold’ is a weapons-grade understatement. It’s an audacious, jaw-dropping examination of what screens & billboards demand of women (especially as they age), and how laughably impossible it is to meet those demands. Well, if you didn’t laugh, you’d cry. After watching THE SUBSTANCE, you might do both.

Demi Moore's performance in The Substance is so potent that it's hard to tell what's more intoxicating; her inevitable Best Actress win or Coralie Fargeat's razor-sharp screenplay that's already got the Oscar in the bag.,7,2024-09-26T10:51:28.161Z,griggs79,unknown,933260,The Substance,movie
"There’s a big difference between being funny and being laughable, yet the latest from writer-director Coralie Fargeat has somehow found a way to be both. After amassing a considerable amount of largely well-earned cinematic goodwill in the film’s opening segments, the picture mercilessly squanders that support in the final act with an overlong, meandering, disgustingly gratuitous and grotesque exhibition of utterly bad taste. This story of an aging actress (Demi Moore) who seeks to revive her career by retrieving some of her lost youth with the aid of an enigmatic injectable follows her grand misadventures when the mysterious substance prompts the emergence of a younger doppelganger (Margaret Qualley), who becomes a Hollywood sex kitten sensation virtually overnight. To make this experimental venture work, however, the two individuals must follow a complex set of rules, dictates that become increasingly difficult to follow as they each vie for their respective shares of attention. And, as this scenario unfolds, tension grows between them, leading to complications and unexpected developments that become progressively harder to manage. But that’s where what works in the film ends. As the story plays out from there, it becomes stupendously absurd, and, even though there are some hearty laughs in this, there are even more ridiculously implausible and unexplained occurrences that try audience members’ patience and tolerance, so much so that I couldn’t wait for this trainwreck to end. In addition to the foregoing shortcomings, the film includes myriad changes in tone, making it difficult to determine whether this is supposed to be a serious thriller or a campy road, very much in the same way as in the incomprehensible French offering “Titane” (2021). It also shamelessly “borrows” elements from other movies in various ways, most notably imagery and narrative references from “The Shining” (1980) and “Young Frankenstein” (1974), costume designs from the “Hunger Games” franchise, and bafflingly inexplicable soundtrack excerpts from films like “Vertigo” (1958). Then there’s the picture’s obvious, heavy-handed message about the perils of misogyny, observations that, as important as they are, could easily stood to have been turned down more than a few notches (yes, we get it already). At the same time, though, there are also some fundamentally innate questions about the narrative that go wholly unanswered, leaving us with numerous head-scratching moments. Sadly, these failings detract significantly from the elements that do work (at least early on in the film), such as the fine performances of Moore and Qualley, the picture’s inventive cinematography, and a central premise that could have made for an engaging story if handled with greater finesse. But these strengths are effectively cancelled by what ultimately results when this release goes off the rails. Indeed, how “The Substance” captured the 2024 Cannes Film Festival award for best screenplay is truly mind boggling. I’m certainly a fan of the weird, wild and wacky, but this release undermines the virtues of those cherished qualities. Regrettably, I was seriously looking forward to seeing this offering, and I was decidedly impressed by what I saw in its opening acts, but that was all wiped out by how this one ultimately played out, a picture that, in the end, ironically relied more on style than “substance.”",5,2024-09-28T04:58:03.527Z,Brent Marchant,unknown,933260,The Substance,movie
"This takes a logical step on from Coralie Fargeat's earlier ""Reality+"" (2014) drama, only this time it takes a much more substantial swipe at all things vain. ""Elisabeth"" (Demi Moore) has been at the top of her fitness game for many a year when her boss ""Harvey"" (Dennis Quaid) decides that she's now too old and that a younger model is needed to present those programmes we all saw on the television of gorgeous, fit and healthy, people showing us how to exercise on a mat in from of our televisions each morning. Distracted by her imminent removal, she is involved in a car accident that introduces her to an handsome young nurse (Robin Grear) and then to a curious invitation to test out a mysterious fluid that can essentially give her her cake and eat it. In best ""Jekyll and Hyde"" tradition, injecting this quite literally creates a split personality. One is her current self, the other a perfect, younger specimen. They work in a rota system each gets a week of consciousness then has to take a week out. Thing is, the more vivacious character ""Sue"" (Margaret Qualley) is not so religious about sticking to these sharing rules and we quickly discover that what is ""borrowed"" can never been returned - with increasingly harrowing results. With the gushing ""Harvey"" determined to capitalise on his new ratings winner, things become decidedly irritating for the now marginalised ""Elisabeth"" - but shat can she do? There's no going back...! I think this is Moore at her best. Her palpable sense of evolving fury, exasperation and frustration is expertly captured as is the selfishness of her alter ego by an on form Qualley. Quaid steals his scenes as the truly odious epitome of corporate greed for whom it's all about the business, the money and never the actual people concerned. The denouement is reminiscent of something concocted by one of the David's - Lynch or Cronenberg, and allows the throbbing ghastliness of this story of vanity gone mad to demonstrate just how fickle life can be when there's little actual substance at all to their shallow and vacuous lives. A savage indictment of the short-term and unprincipled ""beauty"" industry that aims squarely at just about everyone and everything involved, is engagingly toxic and well worth a watch.",6,2024-09-28T06:20:45.132Z,CinemaSerf,unknown,933260,The Substance,movie
"Certainly an experience!

<em>'The Substance'</em> is <b>a lot</b>. It's one of those sorta movies that I needed to let settle in my mind before I even started to think about reviewing it. I'm not even sure where to start. It's insane from pretty much the beginning to the very end of its 140 minute run time, some scenes are particularly rough to watch unfold!

I think the only body horror flick I've seen up until this point is David Cronenberg's <em>'Crimes of the Future'</em> from 2022, which I found to be solid enough but it came across, at least to me, as a bit too forced for shock value. This 2024 release has plenty of that, if not more, but it somehow feels totally at home with what surrounds it.

The story itself is fascinating, even taking out all the craziness with the gore et al. So by no means is this a film that is style over substance (sorry). It isn't anything actually overly original in terms of the base plotline, though the way it is portrayed and brought to life is astounding - every inch is expertly crafted.

Demi Moore is outstanding in this! I haven't seen her in much, at least anything released post-2002, but here she is top quality throughout. Margaret Qualley is obviously the opposite in terms of the former, though is just as fantastic in regards to the latter - great performance!

If you see anyone giving warnings ahead of watching this, they are very much warranted! Even with all the graphic twistedness, which will turn many away, this is an impressively enthralling picture. I may need a lie-down though.",6,2024-10-10T22:58:49.032Z,r96sk,unknown,933260,The Substance,movie
"After the original orgasmatron, we find ourselves back at the very start of the transformer's history with all of the ""Prime"" contraptions having been destroyed in a war and now only ""Sentinel Prime"" exists to lead the bots in a self-perpetuating existence of mining for the fuel that allows them to continue to mine for the fuel. You get the drift. Many of the robots don't have the cogs in their chests necessary to do any transforming, and that includes the lively ""Orion Pax"", his pal ""D-16"" and their feisty supervisor ""Elita-1"", but when a series of incidents occur that sees them escape from their mine onto the forbidden surface they discover an whole new truth that questions not just the history that's been drummed into them, but the very integrity of their leadership. Thing is, can they do anything to thwart a dastardly plan the could ensure the bots stay slaves for ever? As origin stories go, this is one of the better ones. Plenty of action throughout sets a story that doesn't rely (too heavily) on your knowledge of the Hasbro universe, it just allows you to root for the good guys as they battle the menacing and overwhelming forces lined up against them to ensure the new status quo endures and the dead stay exactly that. The story deals with the usual aspects of brotherhood, loyalty, ambition and though there's little actual jeopardy throughout - and, less face it, it's part of an ongoing franchise that's going to run, and run, and run - there's plenty to enjoy as it sets the scene for what's to come. It probably does need a cinema screening to get the best from the grand scale animation and visual effects, and the story and characterisations are not half bad, either.",6,2024-10-16T11:21:45.169Z,CinemaSerf,unknown,698687,Transformers One,movie
"I was going to go and see the first Joaquin Phoenix outing as the ""Joker"" (2019) to remind my self of who did what to whom, but I didn't have time. I think I am glad because I recall that being so very much better than this. Here, we pick up after ""Fleck"" (Phoenix) has been on his clown-faced slaughtering spree and is in prison supervised by prison officer ""Jackie"" (Brendan Gleeson). His lawyer ""Maryanne"" (Catherine Keener) is trying to have him declared competent to stand trial for his crimes so she can plead some sort of personality disorder defence - he's not ""Fleck"" when he's the ""Joker"" sort of thing. Thing is, he encounters ""Lee"" (Lady Gaga) at a prison sing-a-long and she manages to ingratiate herself with him and then to derail that plan ensuring the plot twists it's way into the courtroom where his conviction for multiple homicides quickly appears as inevitable as there being a song in the film. Now I did like the soundtrack, but by the way Todd Phillips has presented this, it might as well have been either Tony Bennett or Newley who took on the leading role as her part is largely a series of entertainingly photographed music videos with the thinnest slices of meat constituting a weak story in between. It's a love story, I suppose, but that wasn't really what I turned up to see. There's loads of excess, but no menace or jeopardy and the character's previous adeptness at treading the thin line between sanity and madness isn't really developed at all here. He comes across more as a pathetic, emaciated, prisoner whose flame has well and truly gone out. His legal antagonist (Harry Lawtey) looks about eleven years old but that doesn't really matter either as the judicial proceedings themselves offer us little by way of sustaining drama, even as we build to a denouement that offers the tiniest bit of hope then... It's a stunning piece of cinema, money has been spent and there's imagination a-plenty from the production's designers. It's just too much of a jigsaw of a film with too little plot serving as a vehicle for an album boxed-set that's doubtless ready to hit the shops.",6,2024-10-05T05:01:49.754Z,CinemaSerf,unknown,889737,Joker: Folie à Deux,movie

""Joker: Folie à Deux holds immense technical and artistic merit, but it fails to replicate the success and impact of the original.

Todd Phillips’ boldness in turning the film into a musical is admirable, but the execution ends up being incoherent, with abrupt transitions between the dark drama and the musical numbers, resulting in a jarring experience, made even more frustrating by the studio’s embarrassing secrecy about the movie’s format.

While visually impressive and with standout performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, the lack of thematic and character development makes this sequel an ambitious yet ultimately disappointing attempt that adds little to the thought-provoking study presented in 2019.""

"Combining movie genres can be tricky business. When the mix is right, the outcome can be truly impressive, but, when it’s off, it can spell cinematic disaster. In the case of this long-awaited sequel to the 2019 box office and critically acclaimed success, unfortunately, the result is closer to the latter than the former. Picking up where the protagonist’s story left off, this saga about charismatic villain Arthur Fleck (a.k.a., the Joker) (Joaquin Phoenix) finds him in prison awaiting trial for his string of heinous crimes. Most of the picture’s first half takes place here, an unlikely venue for Arthur meeting the love of his life, the psychopathic Lee Quinzel (a.k.a., Harley Quinn) (Lady Gaga), who diligently stands by her man when he eventually goes to court, the primary focus of the film’s second half. So, at this point, the picture is already part prison film, part courtroom drama and part dark romance. But, if that weren’t enough, writer-director Todd Phillips draws upon a fourth genre – musicals – to make the mix even more overstuffed (but, hey, if you’ve got a talent like Lady Gaga at your disposal, why not, right?). The result is a convoluted, overlong, often-uninteresting offering that’s heavy on style but weak on substance and not especially interesting. Admittedly, the performances of the two leads and many of the supporting players (Brendan Gleeson, Catherine Keener and Steve Coogan in particular) are quite good, doing a more than commendable job of making this material look far better than it actually is. In addition, stylistically speaking, the picture is terrific when it comes to its production design, costuming and cinematography. And the soundtrack is great, too, including an array of superbly chosen standards to complement the narrative (even if there are a few too many selections). But these strengths by themselves aren’t enough to make a good picture overall; what’s stuck in between these elements feels more like filler than substance, and that’s where the movie falls apart. In my view, “Joker: Folie à Deux” isn’t as resoundingly awful as many reviewers have made it out to be in light of its artistic and aesthetic accomplishments, but that doesn’t mean this release is not without its share of problems, most notably in the dreadful writing and mishandled film editing. This is one of those pictures where you get to the end and are likely to heave a heavy “Ho hum, so what?” And that’s regrettable, given that the character and this picture’s predecessor both deserved better than what this follow-up has to offer. If you haven’t seen this yet, you might be better off sticking to the picture’s genuinely stellar trailer, as that’s ultimately much better than most of what’s found in this clunky 2:18:00 release.",6,2024-10-06T01:53:04.298Z,Brent Marchant,unknown,889737,Joker: Folie à Deux,movie

"Great title, great movie.

I had heard tiny bits about <em>'Joker: Folie à Deux'</em> falling below expectations since its release, though they weren't substantial enough to know if the film was any good or not. I have to say, I really enjoyed watching it all play out. It admittedly isn't on the same level as the phenomenal predecessor, but that's OK - I wasn't expecting it to be.

I will say that making this a musical of sorts was a bold choice, it wouldn't have been the direction that I would've went with it but to be honest I thought they executed it nicely. I presume that is one reason many didn't like this, as well as possibly the lack of craziness that seemed like it was on the horizon based on the 2019 flick. For me, mind, it all works.

Joaquin Phoenix is as excellent as anticipated in his reprisal as Joker, while Lady Gaga is a neat piece of casting for Lee - obviously her music chops for one, though I do enjoy her acting too. Lee perhaps could've been used more, but what we got is more than sufficient in my opinion. Brendan Gleeson, elsewhere, does well in a more minor role.

Is is slightly overlong? Possibly. Did we need a sequel? Probably not. All I can confirm is that I had a positive time viewing it, so I can't harbour any noteworthy complaints. It's a shame to now read that this film has seemingly bombed in more ways than one. C'est la vie.",7,2024-10-18T01:14:47.727Z,r96sk,unknown,889737,Joker: Folie à Deux,movie

"<em>'Alien: Romulus'</em> is actually very good.

Of the more modern day releases from this franchise, this is the one I've enjoyed the most. When I was immediately coming out of the cinema I was just plainly thinking of it as being solidly good, however the more I think about it the more I had fun with this seventh installment.

The plot, or at least the set-up to it, is quite uncreative, as in I feel like so many films - from this series included - have a crew make-up of similar people and similar characteristics/motivations; <em>'Crater'</em> and <em>'I.S.S.'</em> (both very good, don't get me wrong) are recent examples that spring to mind. Happily, though, the rest of the flick makes up for any weakness in that area.

Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson are the great performers in this, I found them both to be excellent throughout. Two actors I want to see much more of, having already seen them in a few pleasing pictures; e.g. <em>'Civil War'</em> and <em>'Rye Lane'</em>.

I also liked the sound design and even the jump scares, which I'm not usually a fan of (bit lazy etc.) but there is enough about how they do them here that it works. Those facehuggers remain brilliantly effective, though the xenomorph isn't amazingly utilised - the human version didn't hit for me, felt <em>'I Am Legend'</em>-esque.

All in all, it's up there as one of my favourites from the franchise. For me, <em>'Alien'</em> and <em>'Aliens'</em> just narrowly better this, though it's a marginal improvement on (the entertaining) <em>'Alien Resurrection'</em> and it surpasses every other release, in my eyes.",6,2024-08-16T18:24:55.893Z,r96sk,unknown,945961,Alien: Romulus,movie
"I gather director Fede Alvarez made a conscious - and probably expensive - decision to keep the use of CGI to a minimum here and it really does work. ""Rain"" (Cailee Spaeny) and her ""brother"" are looking to get off-planet but she can't get travel papers from the all-powerful mining company. Desperate, she and ""Andy"" (David Jonsson) are offered a chance by wide boys ""Tyler"" (Archie Renaux) and ""Bjorn"" (Spike Fearn) to raid a decrepit old spacecraft that appears to be in a decaying orbit, so they can pinch it's cryogenic pods and enable them all to escape to another planet out of reach of their enthralling taskmasters. Off they set onto the ""Romulus"" and that's where, well you just know what's going to happen now, as they inadvertently turn the central heating on and find themselves in mortal danger. ""Andy"" just happens to be a synthetic, which proves especially useful when they discover the remains of ""Rook"" (the spitting image of the late Sir Ian Holm) but is this oozing mess of gunge and wiring actually an help or an hindrance? Getting off is going to be a lot harder than getting on! To be honest, the acting here is really neither here nor there. Renaux and Isabella Merced - their cohort ""Kay"" do enough, Fearn rather over-plays his chip-on-the-shoulder character and there's a slightly soporific effort from Jonsson, but that's not what I was watching for. This is all about the best monsters sci-fi cinema has ever created, and right from their first appearance I was in their corner. There's loads of darkly shot menace crammed into the two hours with plenty of references to it's originator and even more insinuations about the greed of a ""company"" that doesn't know when to leave well alone. Just like the other ""Alien"" films, it takes a Russian Doll approach to the ending, so don't think we're going to get off with just the one, definitive, ""get away from her..."" moment, and of course the lift plays a pivotal part in the proceedings as acid blood drips everywhere. It's not so good as the first two Sigourney Weaver outings, but slips neatly into bronze medal position for me in a series that can still prove quite compellingly scary. It's a cinema must - telly just won't do the lighting and photography justice at all.",5,2024-08-20T08:47:06.469Z,CinemaSerf,unknown,945961,Alien: Romulus,movie
"Whilst not as awful as the Aliens franchise films that came after the excellent first and second films, starring Sigourney Weaver, Alien Romulus is not without its shortcomings. 

Whats immediately noticeable, in spite of the rugged, industrial setting, is a cast that look like they just escaped from the set of Beverly Hills 90210. Youthful, fresh faced, physically unimposing, with not a grease stain or blemish in sight, they feel badly out of place. 

If you can put the sense of disbelief regarding the casting aside (I couldn't) the actual story fares only marginally better. It feels like a borrowed affair, where its taken aspects of the first two successful films and tried to craft a newer iteration.

The results an alright, if at times, somewhat ridiculous story, punctuated by moments of compelling action. That said, haven't we seen it all before, in one form or another? 

In summary, miscasting combined with a story that blandly apes superior earlier films, leads to an ""okay"" watch that's fails to distinguish itself.If you are new to this franchise, my advice start with Alien from 1979 and then its plural successor Aliens, instead.",5,2024-08-21T00:53:05.907Z,MovieGuys,unknown,945961,Alien: Romulus,movie
"Color me thoroughly surprised at how much I was delighted by “Alien: Romulus,” a highly creative, beautifully executed, pulse-pounding science fiction film from director Fede Alvarez. This sequel is a rare gem in the world of big budget franchise flicks because it not only respects its predecessors with thoughtfully well done homages, but also pushes the boundaries of the universe it inhabits with inventive set pieces and a plausible story. Fans of the series and the genre are in for a real treat.

Going back to the roots of the “Alien” franchise, the film tells the story of a group of young space colonizers (Cailee Spaeny, David Jonsson, Archie Renaux, Isabela Merced, Aileen Wu, and Spike Fearn)who are looking for a way out of their current situation as hard laborers on a sunless planet. While searching the universe, they encounter a decommissioned ship that has enough supplies to take them far, far away. Intent on scavenging, the group makes a risky voyage into space where they get far more than they bargained for: a face-to-face encounter with a terrifying life form from which they may have no hope of escape.

The strength of the story is also in its simplicity, and Alvarez uses swift pacing and straightforward character development to create an irresistible hook for audiences. He creates a crackerjack blend of suspense, horror, and science fiction that not only hearkens back to the original films, but also offers up something fresh and modernized for a new generation. Even better, the film is very dark and isn’t dumbed down for casual viewers, which shows a great deal of respect to long-time sci-fi fans. This isn’t just another sequel that is exploiting a franchise’s good will, it actually has some substance.

There’s an atmosphere of dread that commands most of the movie, and the action scenes are imaginative and inspired. I was on the edge of my seat multiple times, and several of the set pieces are visually fun, too. The special effects are not flashy or over-polished like the ones that tend to dominate modern blockbusters (even the alien creature itself remains largely unchanged from its original, iconic 1979 design), which turns out to be the perfect complement to the film’s strong narrative foundation. Heightened tension and fear is created through well-crafted suspense rather than constant visual bombardment. There’s a level of sophistication here that elevates it beyond a mere retread of past “Alien” films.

I was especially surprised about how quickly I started to care about the characters, who don’t exactly give off the best first impression (they seem like they will be stereotypical and highly annoying, but that’s not the case). As the story unfolds, so do the layers of depth and complexity, both which make the fate of these friends matter. The film is well cast, and Spaeny’s versatility shines through in a role that requires both emotional range and physical intensity.

The film is willing to take risks, especially when it comes to killing off characters. The unpredictability of who will survive and who has the wits to escape from harrowing situations adds another layer of tension and sense of danger. Nothing here feels preordained, and that in itself is exciting.

“Alien: Romulus” is a wildly satisfying addition to the franchise because it’s a film that understands what made the original great and uses those elements to create something new and exciting. It succeeds in paying homage to its predecessors while also forging its own identity, honoring its legacy in a way that will have sci-fi nerds salivating for future installments.

"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://movieswetextedabout.com/alien-romulus-review-an-audiovisual-triumph-held-back-by-reverence-to-the-past/

""Alien: Romulus is an impressive technical spectacle that highlights Fede Álvarez's talent in creating an atmosphere of tension and horror, raising the audiovisual standard of the saga to new heights through immersive sound design and Galo Olivares' stunning cinematography, which deserves countless accolades.

However, its excessive reliance on references to the past prevents it from reaching its full narrative potential, as well as achieving a thematic impact similar to the franchise's best installments.

Despite this, the captivating performances of Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson, along with a third act filled with insane entertainment, make this interquel a cinematic experience worth seeing in IMAX, even if it leaves the feeling that it could have been more daring and innovative.""

Rating: B+",6,2024-09-07T07:54:16.843Z,Manuel São Bento,unknown,945961,Alien: Romulus,movie
"Alien: Romulus is a love letter to the 1979 classic, and while I dug the whole philosophical space-god thing in Prometheus, this stripped-down, back-to-basics approach had me hooked from the first frame.  It's been a while since an Alien film truly captured that sense of claustrophobic dread, and Romulus nails it.

This movie is gorgeous, plain and simple. The lighting, the camera angles, and Benjamin Wallfisch's score – it all blends together to create this constant tension that just sucks you in. There's this one scene where Rain, Andy and Tyler are being chased through the research station, the way they use the shadows and movement, it's like a masterclass in suspense. It totally reminded me of the most terrifying moments from the original. It's obvious Álvarez was obsessed with recreating that gritty, lived-in feel of the first Alien, and it pays off big time.

The cast is solid too. Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson absolutely kill it as Rain and Andy.  I'll admit, I was worried Andy would be your typical forgettable sidekick, but he actually gets a pretty interesting arc.  Sure, most of the crew are basically there to get picked off by the Xenomorph, but Andy was a standout supporting character. He basically played two roles. It's refreshing that the movie doesn't waste time with a bunch of unnecessary characters.

One thing this movie does really well is finding that sweet spot between horror and action that made the first two films so iconic.  Alien 3 was so bleak, and Resurrection was just bonkers action – this one feels like a proper blend of both.  Fede Álvarez basically throws in all the best Alien tropes: the ragtag crew, the creepy body horror stuff, the tense hide-and-seek scenes, and some kickass action sequences. And you know what? It totally works.

I was impressed at a lot of the creative set pieces and how they built tension. Like how they played with gravity to avoid the acid and trying to sneak past the facehuggers by camoflaging their body temperature. They were really cool and shockingly unique and fresh for a nearly 50 old franchise. And let's talk about that body horror. There's this one scene, a seriously messed-up vaginal birth, that is going to be burned into my brain for a while. Álvarez definitely gets what makes this franchise tick.

I'm giving Alien: Romulus a strong 7/10.  It lost some points for the use of the CGI Ian Holm. It's so distracting, and they rely on it way too much.  Also, there some lines that were stuck in there for nostalgia that felt out of place.  But honestly, those are minor nitpicks in a movie that's this much fun. The whole final act, with the station crashing into the asteroid field and that epic showdown with the Human/ Xeno, is just pure chaos in the best way possible.

Alien: Romulus is a worthy successor to the Alien throne. It's a visual treat, a thrilling ride, and a damn good reminder of why we love this franchise in the first place.",5,2024-10-16T17:43:30.277Z,Mister BLAQK,unknown,945961,Alien: Romulus,movie

"""Inside Out 2"" is a heartwarming and imaginative sequel that successfully builds on the emotional depth of its predecessor. Directed by Kelsey Mann, the film revisits Riley as she navigates the complexities of teenage life, with her emotions—Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust—returning to guide her.

With its clever storytelling, humor, and poignant moments, ""Inside Out 2"" resonates deeply with audiences, offering a thoughtful exploration of growing up and emotional resilience.",6,2024-06-06T10:47:54.037Z,Hotplix,unknown,1022789,Inside Out 2,movie
"The wizards at Pixar have crafted a new gem with “Inside Out 2” which is a rare achievement in that it is a sequel that outdoes the original film.

The movie opens with Riley (Kensington Tallman), just after her 13th Birthday as Joy (Amy Poehler) recaps her accomplishments and sets the stage for her big Hockey Game with her friends Grace (Grace Lu) and Bree (Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green).

Their success on the ice attracts the attention of the coach of the local Firebirds who invites the trio to a three-day camp which will set the stage for them to be included on the team as freshmen.

Things take a turn when a Puberty alarm goes off followed by a construction crew to upgrade the console. Fear (Tony Hale), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Liza Lapira), and Sadness (Phyllis Smith),  do not react well to this and the arrival of the new emotions Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Ennui  (Adèle Exarchopoulos), and Embarrassment (Paul Walter-Hauser), sets the stage for new conflicts.

Riley arrives at camp and becomes enchanted with the popular girls who are fronted by Valentina (Lilimar), and Riley excludes her friends as a chance to be part of the in-crowd.

The new emotions set a course to keep Riley safe from her potential future issues and banish the old emotions that they view as hindering Riley and setting a path for future failure.

Forced to travel to the furthest reaches of Riley’s mind to recover something of necessity; the old emotions hope to undo the damage being done and restore Riley who is in the turmoil of being a teen and hampered by the flood of new and often conflicting emotions and circumstances that she encounters.

The movie is filled with charm and humor as well as presenting an honest look at the changes and pressures that children face during their teen years and does so without being heavy-handed. The emotions new and old are great and there are many moments throughout the film that will bring laughter as well as nostalgia for adults; especially those with children who are about to enter their Teen years.

The film is moving and there were more than a few eyes welling up near the end of the film during our screening as Pixar has once again crafted an enjoyable and relatable tale that can be enjoyed by the entire family.

"I really quite enjoyed the first of these (2015) but I struggled a bit to stay engaged with the one. ""Riley"" is still happily coasting through family life until one day, she embarks on the yellow brick road that is puberty. Towit, her control gallery is no longer the purview of just her lifelong guides like ""Fear"", ""Joy"" and ""Anger"" - now she has also to deal with the likes of disgust, envy, boredom and worst of all - anxiety. It's maybe the latter that the film should be called as we now embark on quite a humourless swipe at the culture of validation that young people must navigate. It's all about being popular. Being liked. Being the best - in the ice hockey team. Old loyalties go under the bus in favour of new aspirations and yes, much of it does ring quite true as an evaluation of the fickleness in all of us. Thing is, though, there's just too much inevitability about what comes next and there's way too much incessant dialogue. ""Anger"" has some fun along the way, and there is the odd comedy one-liner from the laconic ""Ennui"" but it just didn't resonate with me at all. The animation is standard Pixar fayre that does the job colourfully but unremarkably, and by the conclusion I was hoping there was an off button on that great big console. Yep - I'm probably too old to really appreciate this the way the kids can, but the trick for these studios has to be to engage the adults at the same time as the weans, else out come the mobile phones as our own version of ennui sets in.

"Poor Pixar! They just haven't been able to catch a break this decade! Having a majority of their originals dumbed on Disney+, Lightyear flopping, and Elemental just barely managing to make a comeback after having the studio's worst opening yet. They just can't catch a break, specially with Disney laying off their animators and refusing to let them make any originals anymore. Safe to say, they've had it rough! But Inside Out 2, despite many things working against it actually managed to be good, in fact great! Almost as good as its predecessor. I'm not gonna fully say it's a masterpiece like any of their older films, or even films like Soul or the first Inside Out, but it's still a pretty great movie! A movie that honors the original while adding to the original's themes. Instead of just being the first movie again, they actually do things a little different, by adding new emotions, covering the themes of puberty and anxiety, and adding some new locations. I also like how they don't just reset Joy back to the way she was in movie 1, they actually stick to her character development, letting the others help her, especially Sadness, and being open to new ideas. She's still flawed, of course, but it's more still growing as a character rather than just learning the same lesson again. They even subvert the originals message. Inside Out 1: it's okay to not be happy. Inside Out 2: It's okay to let happiness in. You are valued and you are good enough. There's also one scene in the movie : the panic attack. I won't spoil what happens but I really love how this scene played out. Altogether, a pretty solid film that builds on the original ti the point where I'd actually say I'd be open for a 3rd movie, something I thought I'd never, ever say ever!!! Congrats, Pix! U made a good sequel, keep it up!

"When I first heard about the sequel to Inside Out, I approached it with a mix of excitement and apprehension. The original film is a masterpiece, one of Pixar’s finest achievements, seamlessly blending humor, emotion, and a profound understanding of human psychology. Given Pixar’s recent uneven track record, I feared that the sequel might not live up to the high standards set by its predecessor. However, I am delighted to report that isn't the case here.

I can confidently say that Inside Out 2 is a worthy successor to the original. It almost reaches the same level of excellence, taking the story in a fresh direction with a new cast of characters that enrich the narrative.

The sequel introduces a beautifully nuanced character: Anxiety, portrayed by Maya Hawke. Hawke’s performance brings a sympathetic depth to the role, making Anxiety a character that audiences can relate to and care for. The character adds a layer of complexity to the story that resonates on multiple levels. Anxiety's interactions with Joy, played masterfully once again by Amy Poehler, highlight the inevitable struggles of growing up. Poehler’s Joy continues to be the heart of the film.

The story’s emotional core remains as powerful as ever. As a father, the original film spoke to me deeply about understanding and acknowledging my children's emotions all by extension. This sequel shifts the focus inward, reflecting the internal emotional landscape of adolescence and early adulthood. Riley, our protagonist, is growing up, and the introduction of more complex emotions reflects the reality of her development. The film brilliantly captures the awkwardness and discomfort of this transition, making it relatable for both younger audiences and adults.

Some interactions in the film are cringe-worthy because they are so true to life. We've all experienced moments of anxiety and self-doubt, and seeing them portrayed so authentically on screen is both uncomfortable and cathartic. 

Amy Poehler's portrayal of Joy remains a highlight, and Maya Hawke’s Anxiety is a beautifully crafted antagonist who evolves throughout the film. By the end, Anxiety isn’t just a source of conflict but a character that facilitates growth and understanding. This development adds depth to the narrative, making it more than just a children’s film but a profound exploration of emotional growth.

Inside Out 2 is a summer movie that stands as a high point for family entertainment. It balances humor and emotion with a storyline that speaks to both children and adults. Pixar has once again delivered a film that not only entertains but also enlightens, reminding us of the importance of understanding and embracing all our emotions. For anyone who loved the first film, this sequel is a must-watch, capturing the same magic while exploring new emotional territory.

If you cherished the original for its insightful portrayal of emotions, you will find Inside Out 2 a worthy and enriching continuation of Riley’s journey. It’s a film that promises to be both a hit with families and a valuable conversation starter about the complex world of emotions.",6,2024-07-09T14:21:50.441Z,TheSceneSnobs,unknown,1022789,Inside Out 2,movie
"""Inside Out 2"" brilliantly follows up its predecessor with a heartwarming and deeply insightful exploration of the human mind. Directed by Pete Docter and produced by Pixar Animation Studios, this sequel delves even deeper into the complexities of emotions, creating a movie that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.

The film continues the story of Riley, now a teenager, navigating the tumultuous waters of adolescence. The return of our beloved emotions—Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust—offers a delightful reunion while introducing new emotional characters that reflect the evolving complexity of Riley's inner world. Each emotion is beautifully voiced, bringing authenticity and depth to their characters. Amy Poehler’s Joy and Phyllis Smith’s Sadness once again shine, their dynamic evolving in ways that are both surprising and deeply moving.",6,2024-07-20T06:54:49.787Z,minion196,unknown,1022789,Inside Out 2,movie
"Inside Out 2 is a suggestion to follow Riley’s troubles during adolescence, which adds new characters to this animated movie – Anxiety and Envy, – besides Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust. Both animation and voice acting are great, and the animation properly shows the confusion and disorder of a teenage girl’s mind. Compared to ‘Toy Story 2,’ it may not be as rich in genuine sentiment, but it returns all viewers, children, and adults, to the challenge of the act of growing up.

I also enjoyed the comedy and the themes present in it and maybe because of the continuous showings or better comprehension of it allowed me to have less of a feeling compare to the first one although at some parts it is sort of teary. It was interesting to see how Joy and Anxiety interacted with each other these characters are more real in terms of showing us how emotions work during decision-making when you’re in trouble.

"I honestly don't know what everyone's talking about, _Venom_ is **fine**! I mean... It's not great. There were a few moments I found myself thinking ""This bit's pretty bad, why did they do this?"" and a lot of moments I found myself thinking ""This bit's pretty good, but they still probably should have just made a **real** _Venom_ movie with Marvel.""

But it's fine. The absolute best parts are the interactions taking place within Venom himself (between Brock and the Symbiote) and the movie would have been a lot worse if Tom Hardy wasn't capable of pulling that off. Look, a _Venom_ movie probably should have been rated R, and it probably should have taken more notes from current superhero movies than superhero movies from fifteen years ago, but I still had a good time with _Venom_, maybe it's not the best possible version of the story, but I'm still glad we have this one.

"Venom is a great comic adaptation. I really like what they did with the character and the story. I thought the film was done well. The special effects are pretty good. I thought the characters were cast well, and overall I just enjoyed it. The film is pretty dark and violent despite the PG-13 rating. It didn't have a lot of blood, but there was a bit here and there. Characters are mostly tossed around and beaten, but a lot of them are not shown dead. That being said, some characters are still killed on screen. People are experimented on. A few people are slashed and stabbed. Guns are used, but not frequently. It definitely pushed the PG-13 as far as it could. There is a lot of language throughout, including an f-bomb. There is also a lot of drinking. I definitely recommend this movie. I think it is better suited for teens and up, but older kids that can handle strong violence may be okay.",6,2018-10-27T13:08:50.548Z,gurteksingh,unknown,335983,Venom,movie

"Venom - **SPOILERS**

4/10

There seems to be quite a bit of agreement on what Im about to say about the film. Venom doesnt quite know what it is. It cant decide wether its a goofy, action or a horror movie. Therefore its all of it and none at the same time. 

The goofy jokes are pretty lame, which is why they are funny, you dont laugh with the writers, you laugh at them. 

The action scenes are meh at best, 
car chase : check
motorcycle : check
ridiculous (bad) cgi fight: check
sure, watching Tom Hardy motorcross in San Francisco is quite fun, but its not really action. 

Finally, the horror; there are glimpses, glimmers of hope scattered around this movie. Little snippets of what could have been, but as soon as they appear they disappear. 

Two scenes really stood out to me due to their potential. After quite a lot of buildup of Venom getting into the building (BY RUNNING UP IT), Eddie decides to take the lift down. Instead of having Eddie walk into the SWAT team, they should have been swarming the building crawling through the floors looking for him. Then, they could have had an ALIEN like hunting scene where Venom slowly takes out the task force one by one, in true horror movie fashion. 

The other obvious horror scene could have been using the creepy little girl that delivers RIOT to the Musk wannabe, they could have homaged The Shining, they could have pulled an exorcist, they could have done a million things, but the little girl just has white pupils and a deep voice.

Throughout the movie there are just continuous disappointments because you see what it is missing. 

Instead of the cheap love story and all the stupid overdone things they should have been ballsy with their movie. Yes the movie DID make 800+ million, however im sure it was going to do that anyway. Venom is probably one of the most badass characters in comic history, and Tom Hardy is Tom Hardy. 

I would have loved to see something along these lines:

Symbiote hunts Eddie. 
Symbiote captures Eddie and they become Venom.
Venom starts unleashing hell because he can, hunts SWAT etc. 
Venom goes after Musk wannabe and Kills him.

Throw some more horror elements in there, and it would have made for a much more satisfactory watch. I have always adored Venom, and this movie had so much potential, but it was all for nothing. No rewatchability. Nothing worth remembering. Just a flick.

It was funny seeing Tom Hardy being a bit of a pussball, but even he cant help a crap script and an even worse film.",5,2019-01-19T02:08:56.264Z,lancethedealer,unknown,335983,Venom,movie
"It’s school holidays here in France which means the kids are at my place which in turn means lot’s of time in front of the screen. Last night it was Venom’s turn to be plopped into my Blu-ray player.

I have to say that I was a little disappointed. Sure it is a good movie and I did indeed enjoy it but not as much as I thought I would. According to the ratings it looked like the majority of the audience liked it a lot and I do like the character Venom. Sure the culture elite and politically correct idiots that Rotten Tomates use as “critics” claimed it to be rotten but, for me, that’s usually a good sign when it comes to my entertainment value from a movie.

The good things are that I found Venom, the creature, really cool. I liked his voice, his appearance and his no-nonsense attitude. The special effects and the action was very enjoyable to watch. Luckily that was my main reason for watching the movie. Actually, it is probably the main reason I want to watch any Marvel movie, especially lately given the poor quality of writers that Marvel has employed.

I guess it is a plus as well that there was not too much politically correct, green or social preaching in it. I am sure those so inclined can find more than me if they go looking for it but most of the movie audience, at least not for this type of movie, probably could not care less.

The main reason I felt somewhat disappointed is that the main protagonist is really not someone I could feel like I would root for. He is such a despicable douche-bag. For starters he is a low life journalist with an overblown ego and disrespect of pretty much everything. The kind CNN would employ. Even when he’s been infected by Venom he continues between being a worthless egoistic coward and just an asshole. Actually the only real difference between the him and the big bad guy is that the bad guy is a hundred times more intelligent. It’s not until the very end scenes that Eddie develops a minimum of likability.

On the other hand Venom is really the star of the movie. Both as a “thing” and as a character. He is a real bad-ass, quite funny and really everything that Eddie should have been as a character. He even develops more as a character than previously mentioned douche-bag.

It’s a shame since otherwise this would have been a great movie. The story is simple but works well for this kind of movie. There are no silly twists and convoluted sub-plots. The main protagonist, as poor as he is, at least do not carry a lot of past history trying to explain God knows what and such stuff.

If the character of the main protagonist would have been more likable this would have been a great movie. Now it is “just” good.",6,2019-02-22T08:37:45.190Z,Per Gunnar Jonsson,unknown,335983,Venom,movie

"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/venom-spoiler-free-review

""Venom is yet another missed opportunity to deliver a great movie about the symbiote anti-hero. 

This time, the character of Eddie Brock is beautifully handled, with Tom Hardy offering an impressive performance. The actor carries the entire film, which finds its entertainment peak in the interactions between Eddie and Venom. 

Unfortunately, the movie is drastically brought down by a generic narrative with an incredibly dull first half, an unnecessary focus on uninteresting subplots, and a disappointing amount of paper-thin characters. The shockingly terrible editing basically ruins any sort of excitement that could be found during the action sequences. 

The production issues condemned this film to be a letdown. Let's just hope the next one isn't worse.""

I enjoyed <em>'Venom'</em>, in short. Tom Hardy is one of my favourite actors and I thoroughly enjoyed his showing here as the titular character.

I loved this I have been a huge Venom fan since he debuted in comics. Tom Hardy did great. Much better than Bane.,8,2022-07-26T08:39:19.279Z,Martha,unknown,335983,Venom,movie
"It's getting 10 stars because I have a simple policy that, if the movie entertains, it did it's job.

That being said...it's jarring watching it as a comic book fan. You're constantly fighting the urge to look at the TV and yell ""That's not how it happened!""

I don't think Eddie was as much of a scumbag as he should have been...but Hardy was far better than Grace. And they symbiote wasn't exactly as fun as it was in the comics...but then you only really heard one side of the conversation in the comics.

For an origin story, it was fun...but with Venom being one of the best known Spidey characters, and with Spidey being one of the best known comic book characters...was an origin story necessary? Especially one that was going to change so much of the character?

It could have easily started off after the origin and rolled along on its way as to not irk the fans of the comics.

Despite all of that, it was a well balanced mix of amusing and dark, and those combinations usually tend to work...even if it didn't have the blood that gore that would have sent the film over the top in best possible way.

You get your money's worth watching it. And it's not something that you'll regret seeing...that is unless you're one of those people that can't get past butchering the source material.",6,2023-01-14T00:07:57.979Z,GenerationofSwine,unknown,335983,Venom,movie

"Its story may not be the strongest, but the comedy makes <em>'Deadpool & Wolverine'</em> an excellent watch!

There are some top notch gags in there, particularly to do with the recent offscreen changes for Wade Wilson's alter ego. As you'd expect with Ryan Reynolds in this role, the jokes are plentiful and there is barely any time to react to one before another appears. That can sometimes not work as well as intended, e.g. <em>'Deadpool 2'</em>, but here the humour is executed perfectly.

Reynolds himself is quality, it is a quintessential Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool performance. It's real neat to see Hugh Jackman back as Wolverine, he does play second fiddle to the other titular character but still more than holds his own, as you'd expect. Emma Corrin, meanwhile, enters the MCU with a great showing.

As noted at the top, I do think the plot couldn't been superior - but not in a negative way. What is portrayed is still entertaining to watch, it's just not necessarily on the same level as the comedic elements. A fun watch, all the same. Do I like it more than the 2016 original? I think so, would only be minorly so though.",6,2024-07-25T23:00:25.482Z,r96sk,unknown,533535,Deadpool & Wolverine,movie

"In moviemaking, sadly, there can be a problem with going to the well too many times, and this latest installment in one of filmdom’s better cinematic franchises verges on proving just that. This offering’s predecessors (2016, 2018) significantly distinguished themselves from the kind of fare typically found in the superhero genre with their outrageously bawdy humor, hilarious sight gags and relentlessly maverick attitude. This time out, however, director Shawn Levy’s latest effort is a decidedly hit or miss affair, with an often-incoherent script that feels like it was cobbled together from a collection of leftover parts, some of which work and some of which don’t. I suppose that’s not entirely surprising from a screenplay that was penned by four different writers, making me wonder how much consensus was in place in compiling the finished product. Moreover, this film appears to be intended to fold the Deadpool franchise into the X-Men franchise, an intriguing idea that, regrettably, is handled rather clumsily (as has often been the case with many other recent fusion offerings in the Marvel Universe). And, if all that weren’t bad enough, this release gives short shrift to the colorful cast of supporting players that made the Deadpool films so funny, original and enjoyable, relegating them to little more than cameos in favor of walk-ons by a host of other MCU characters (some of them remarkably obscure, I might add) in an attempt to help cement the franchise cross-pollination going on here. It makes for awkward storytelling at times, especially for viewers who might not be familiar with these lesser-known figures, some of which are drawn from Marvel source material unrelated to its big screen offerings. To the picture’s credit, it features yet another stellar turn by Ryan Reynolds as the off-color protagonist, as well as its share of hilarious bits (without a doubt the franchise’s historically strongest suit), including a number of unabashed, razor-sharp asides referencing off-screen developments related to the studios that produced these films and the actors who have appeared in them. These strengths notwithstanding, however, this is a production that has sadly watered down the elements that best made this franchise work in favor of an overarching programming agenda that simply doesn’t serve this film or the series particularly well. The creators would have served themselves and viewers better by sticking with what works and the basics of good storytelling than trying to force an issue for the sake of future productions that may or may not work over the long term. This has been a noticeable downfall in the quality of many of the most recent Marvel Universe releases, and I’d truly hate to see this franchise befall a similar fate.",6,2024-07-27T23:10:02.772Z,Brent Marchant,unknown,533535,Deadpool & Wolverine,movie

"Well the ""Deadpool"" concept is now well and truly immersed in the Marvel multi-verse and I really did fear for good old ""Dead"". More of the same? Well, no actually. Ryan Reynolds has reverted more to the occasionally quite vulgar humour of the first film (2016) and allowed this trequel to focus more on the personality of this irreverent, immortal, superhero as he tries to resurrect the recently departed ""Wolverine/Logan"" (Hugh Jackman) so he can save his timeline from erasure. To do that, and thwart the comically menacing ""Paradox"" (Matthew Macfadyen), he has to face down ""Cassandra Nova"" (Emma Corrin) - who happens to be the long estranged twin sister of ""Xavier"" who presides over the void. That's a ""Mad Max"" style desert style territory where all the undesirables have been put by ""Paradox"" and his organisation over the years. Initially, there's no love lost between our two heroes. The cocky man in red lycra does not impress his new, booze-soaked and guilt-ridden buddy, but quickly they manage to align their priorities and then - well yes, you can guess the rest. Indeed, there's nothing remotely unpredictable about any of this, but what it does do is shout loudly and proudly that it knows it. It's not trying to reinvent the wheel, it's succeeding in pointing out that all of these multi-verse films that simply adjust the space/time continuum to provide a new setting for the same old stories ad characters has to stop before we (the audience) bore further of their repetitive combat cycles and nondescript plot lines. Maybe Reynolds does over-egg the smuttiness a little but there are still plenty of wry comments about the industry, product placement and the plethora of films (and actors) that have preceded it delivering same old same old. It's not forgotten to entertain us too - there are loads of action scenes and there's an amiable chemistry between two actors who are clearly on the same, suitably sarcastic, page throughout a two hours that also features a some fun cameos from the likes of Messrs. Evans, Snipes, Cavill, Favreau and Tatum to keep it moving along with an effervescence of spirit. It's a big screen essential, there's a lot of effort gone into the production that won't work so well on the telly, and I enjoyed it.",5,2024-07-29T06:24:25.060Z,CinemaSerf,unknown,533535,Deadpool & Wolverine,movie
"Deadpool and Wolverine is a movie that I truly believe the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has needed for a while. After years of lackluster installments, this film is a breath of fresh air. Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman, and director Shawn Levy approached this project with care and a deep understanding of what fans want. The film feels like it was crafted by fans for fans, particularly those who have been frustrated by the recent phases of the MCU.

Reynolds and Levy brought on a team of writers with a strong background in comedy and storytelling. This decision pays off, as the film’s humor and narrative are both sharp and engaging. For example, the meta vibe of Deadpool, familiar from the previous two films, is ramped up significantly. The movie spares no one, making jokes about everything from Hugh Jackman’s recent divorce to Ryan Reynolds' career. However, it’s the MCU that receives the most pointed and critical jokes, which will resonate with long-time fans.

The chemistry between Reynolds and Jackman is electric, bringing new life to both characters. Their dynamic is both hilarious and heartfelt, making for a compelling narrative. For instance, scenes where Deadpool and Wolverine banter while taking down enemies are filled with wit and energy, showcasing their unique bond. This camaraderie extends to the film’s supporting cast, with well-timed cameos and clever nods to previous Marvel movies.

The film's self-awareness and willingness to poke fun at its own franchise are refreshing. This level of meta-commentary sets the film apart from typical superhero fare.

Despite its comedic approach, the film doesn’t skimp on emotional depth. The storyline is carried by genuine heart, particularly in how it addresses themes of redemption and friendship. The climax is especially impactful, ranking among the greats in the franchise.

This isn't just a good sequel; it's a game-changer for the MCU. The film successfully integrates Deadpool into the broader Marvel Cinematic Universe while maintaining his unique tone and style. It sets the stage for future installments, promising exciting developments ahead. The way the film navigates these transitions feels seamless, ensuring that Deadpool’s irreverent humor doesn’t clash with the MCU’s established tone.

Overall, Deadpool and Wolverine is a standout entry in the MCU, offering a perfect blend of humor, action, and heart. Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman deliver top-notch performances, supported by a smart script and deft direction from Shawn Levy. This film not only redeems past missteps in the franchise but also paves the way for a promising future. It’s a must-watch for any Marvel fan, filled with laughter, thrills, and touching moments that elevate it above many of its predecessors.",6,2024-07-30T16:14:59.429Z,TheSceneSnobs,unknown,533535,Deadpool & Wolverine,movie
"It feels a bit rushed... but then it was rushed.  It feels a bit neutered, but it's now Disney and they did muzzle it.

The thing is though... it's not woke, which is why you have articles criticizing it for ""Not Being Gay Enough"" and in 2024, that very literally translates to: ""They focused on a story and characters rather than a political agenda and we're mad about it."" Which, in turn, translates to ""Actually entertaining.""

It's amazing how articles complaining about a movie not being Gay enough can guarantee you that the movie is going to be good.

Only.... it's meh.  I mean, when you compare it to most of the movies this year it's pretty epic.  When you compare it to most of the post 2016 movies this is one of the greatest things ever made... but when you compare it to the other Deadpool movies it's rushed.

But... who cares, it literally doesn't have a point other than entertaining you, and that is really all that matters and all that I ask for.

Is it a cash grab? Yes, and I will GLADLY give them my money for another movie that just wants to entertain.  And if they make another movie that wants to entertain and not push an agenda, I will gladly give them MORE of my money... because at the end of the day, entertainment has been in a decade long drought brought to you by political lecturing and nerd domains have been intentionally attacking fans rather than making movies, like this, that make fans want to give them their money.

"I just watched Deadpool & Wolverine, and wow, it was an absolute blast! Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman have incredible chemistry that makes the whole movie work. Deadpool's irreverent humor and Wolverine's gruff seriousness balance each other perfectly. The film is packed with hilarious jokes, epic action sequences, and so many Easter eggs that comic book fans will be thrilled.

The opening sequence had me hooked right away, with a mix of intense fighting and Deadpool's signature humor. The constant fourth-wall breaks were spot-on and kept the laughs coming. It's a fantastic tribute to both characters and their histories, with plenty of nods to past films and comics.

If you're a fan of either character, this movie is a must-see. It's not just a fun ride; it's a love letter to the fans. The pacing is perfect, and the two hours flew by. Whether you're a casual viewer or a hardcore fan, Deadpool & Wolverine delivers on all fronts. Don't miss it!",6,2024-08-05T21:32:01.314Z,Pringo,unknown,533535,Deadpool & Wolverine,movie
"For devout Marvel fans only.

Here is a test for franchise films: Remove the IP and characters to see if the story, character development, etc. stands on its own without using the IP as a crutch.
If you remove the IP in this case, you have absolutely nothing.

If you've seen a lot of previous Marvel films in this universe, you will be treated with an abundance of fan service. Admittedly, I have not watched a lot of these films. I have, however, watched the first two Deadpool entries. I enjoyed them at the time, especially the first one.

In this third entry, you will find a lot of cameos which are absolutely pointless, except for people to chug memberberries, as they do absolutely nothing with these characters. It doesn't even properly show the backstory of Wolverine.
This film is an almost non-stop barrage of bickering and snarky jokes, but it's never given any time at all to breathe. The few moments where it actually tries to convey emotion, it never truly lands, as all it wants to do is tell jokes. Did I laugh here and there? Sure. But I can count it on one hand.

The villain and plot quite forgettable, and you never truly feel that something's at stake, as the threat is mainly conveyed as a progress bar on a screen...

There were a lot of mentions of Marvel, jokes about production companies & about production crew/cast (extras, etc). As someone who's passionate about this industry and is very active in the business, this film is a big success in my opinion. I loved that we got to see Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan in the intro of the film, just sad we didn't get a little Tony Stark (RDJ) appearance, but hey, it's not his movie after all (RIP Iron Man).",6,2024-08-25T18:39:10.750Z,davidrobitaille,unknown,533535,Deadpool & Wolverine,movie
"Finally, the moment I have been eagerly waiting for has arrived - the new film featuring Deadpool and Wolverine! I am thrilled to share my thoughts on this without revealing any spoilers, so brace yourself for a fairly tame review to keep the surprise intact for everyone.

Marvel is back in its element with this movie, as it takes a playful jab at itself. Deadpool boldly declares that the Multiverse is a mess and proposes putting an end to it - a refreshing take on the superhero genre.

The dance sequence is a hilarious throwback to the 90s, adding a touch of nostalgia and charm to the film. And yes, there is plenty of colorful language, including an abundance of the infamous F word - but then again, what else would you expect from Deadpool?

Prepare to be amazed by some incredible cameos that will leave you jumping out of your seat with excitement, especially if you have a soft spot for certain characters from the past. This movie is an absolute thrill ride that pays homage to the Fox universe and its beloved characters.

Without giving too much away, there is a surprising appearance by a fan-favorite character who never made it to the superhero league, and the moment is truly jaw-dropping. The storyline may seem chaotic, but that's all part of the Deadpool charm.

While the villain could have been utilized more effectively given their power, the relationship between Deadpool and Wolverine is beautifully portrayed. The film does a commendable job of explaining the backstory and the humor is on point, with Deadpool's witty jabs and references adding to the entertainment.

If you're a fan of Deadpool and his legacy, this movie is a must-watch that will blow your mind. Just be warned, there is a fair amount of profanity, so consider this if you're planning to bring along younger viewers. 

Overall, this movie was a blast and one of the most enjoyable Marvel experiences in recent memory. From the creative storytelling to the hilarious antics, it's a wild ride that you won't want to miss. And don't forget to stick around for the mid-credits and end-credits scenes for an extra dose of fun and closure to the film.

"""Dantès"" (Pierre Niney) is to be promoted to captain a ship for the wealthy ""Morrel"" (Bruno Raffaelli) after he disobeyed orders at sea and dived in to rescue a woman from drowning. This action immediately earns him the enmity of the now fired captain ""Danglars"" (Patrick Mille) and then just as his joy is to be complete with his marriage to ""Mercedes"" (Anaïs Demoustier) the soldiers arrive and he's implicated in a Napoleonic plot! The prosecutor, ""de Villefort"" (Laurent Lafitte) appears sympathetic and accepts his pleas of innocence, but when his close friend ""Morcef"" (Bastien Bouillon) is called upon to vouch for ""Dantès"" his own envious agenda takes hold and next, our naive young seaman is heading to the solitude of the Chateau D'If from which prisoners never escape. As the years of relentless frustration and boredom go by, his only conversation is a regular call from his jailers to see if he's still alive. Then a miracle occurs. Another prisoner has been tunnelling for years and inadvertently breaks through to his cell. It's this man - the Abbé Faria (Pierfrancesco Favino) - who gives him more than a little education as they try to dig their way to the sea wall. It's not to be for both, though, but armed with a knowledge that could change his life for ever, he manages to trick the guards and make it to land. It's now that the story of revenge hots up as we jump forward a few years and are introduced to the eponymous Count. He travels in style, has great wealth and style and is determined to avenge himself on the three men who framed him. As with himself, these men have gone on to great things with his denouncing friend now married to his love, ""Danglars"" owning a great trading fleet and the prosecutor now a powerful state official. ""Dantès"" has used his time well, assembling some allies whose roles in this unfolding drama are gradually revealed to us as politics, greed and jealousy stride to the fore of this classically designed production. The lavish costumes, stately homes and opulence of their lives contrasts well with the poverty and ruin faced by those collaterally damaged by the ambitions of men who cared but for themselves, and for whom our dashing and calculation gazillionaire is gunning. Nimey (who occasionally looked a bit like Kevin Kline here?) delivers that wronged and now Machiavellian characterisation especially well. There are also strong efforts from the younger characters ""Albert"" (Vassili Schneider); ""André"" (Julien De Saint Jean) and ""Haydée"" (Anamaria Vartolomei). It's essentially a thoroughly potent story of revenge, but it's as much about just how that can become a toxic influence that can eat into a man's soul and the challenge for ""Dantès"" and those around him whom he loves - however unwillingly on the surface - is not to become an obsessed demon every bit as ghastly as those he wishes to punish. It's this slow, dripping, evolution that the film delivers enthrallingly as we see this troubled man tread an increasingly conflicted line between love and hate. Revenge is said to be a dish best served cold, but like most things served cold - it doesn't keep for long.",6,2024-09-03T07:12:07.072Z,CinemaSerf,unknown,1084736,The Count of Monte-Cristo,movie
"When audiences last saw Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy); the journalist and his parasitic symbiote Venom; had just saved the day and cemented their unusual bond with one another.

In the new film “Venom: Let There Be Carnage”; Eddie and Venom are at the end of their Honeymoon phase as Venom is lingering to be free to eat bad people and do what is natural for him. Eddie meanwhile wants a more conservative approach feeding Venom chicken and chocolate as he knows the eyes of the authorities are still upon him and he has to convince the world that Venom is dead and no longer a threat.

At the same time; serial killer Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson) has selected Eddie to interview him in San Quentin and the two form an unusual connection as Cletus cryptically speaks to Eddie which underlines a deeper motivation.

With the help of Venom; Eddie is able to decipher clues found on the walls of Cletus’s cell which leads authorities to several of his victims. This results in a rapid rise in status for Eddie and fast tracks Cletus for execution as his main means of leverage is now gone.

This leads to a rift where Eddie and Venom split and each has to struggle to adjust to life without one another.

At this point, the film has mainly been odd bits of whimsy between Venom and Eddie around the establishment of the plot and threat. However, things go into chaos mode when Cletus becomes infected with a Symbiote and turns into a destruction spewing death machine known as “Carnage”.

Cletus and Carnage both have their own agendas and Cletus uses Carnage to exact his revenge as well as locate a figure from his past that is as big a danger as he is.

As any fan of films of this genre knows; this scenario leads to a showdown between the central characters which are awash in abundant CGI, loud noises, and destruction. While this is not a bad thing and certainly one of the main reasons I enjoy films of this type; the film never seemed to fully click for me and as such was not as good as I thought it could have been.

In many ways, the film reminded me of how comic-based films were done before Marvel started their own studios and their phenomenal run of hits based on their work.

There have been multiple attempts to adapt comics into films over the last few decades and many of them have not lived up to expectations or failed outright. One of the biggest reasons is in my opinion is that those behind the projects were hindered by the studio, wanted to put their own spin on the material and strayed from the source; or failed to show the attributes that made the characters so appealing to fans.

What we often get is action sequences and CGI galore but without stories or characters that fully draw in the audience and fail to capture the essence of the comics.

Director Andy Serkis has done a great job with the visuals of the film but the tone seems off. The early part of the film is filled with comedic moments that are either hit or miss. Some of which was almost to the point where I wondered if it was supposed to be a parody.

The plot is fairly linear with nothing unexpected as it is simply bad guys get loose; bad guys cause death and destruction, can the heroes stop them. The climactic scene lacks any “wow” moments for me as it was mainly CGI characters rapidly moving around causing damage to one another and their environment. There was no real tension for me and the ultimate resolution seemed a bit anti-climactic.

For me the best moment of the film was a mid-credits scene that really popped as it sets up all sorts of interesting options and indicates that Venom may be about to graduate to bigger and better things.

For now; the cast is solid as is the CGI; I just wish the story was more engaging as it had the potential to be so much more.

"Let There be Carnage!

It is a not bad movie to watch.  The story regarding the birth of Carnage is different than the comic but works in the time they used to show this story.  The movie does not give a ton of back story on the dual villains in the story but they show the love they have for one another.  

The movie is short and very fast pace.  It also has plenty of comedy between the hosts and the symbiotes.  

Overall the movie sets up for a Venom 3 and an inclusion of Venom into the MCU.  If the relationship between Sony & Marvel can continue to be good fans of the franchise will have a bright future ahead.",6,2021-10-16T00:40:23.907Z,Cal,unknown,580489,Venom: Let There Be Carnage,movie

**A "" UPSIDES-1ST, If You Please { I write "" Exclusively Constructive ✅ "" Reviews ; Here're Some Of The Movie's Plus-Points, Right Up Front } "" :** 1 : There's a LOT of -Very- entertaining humour right the way through ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" ( to be referred to henceforth as 'V2' ) . . . . from 'Eddie Brock' ( Tom Hardy )'s ""Odd Couple"" style interactions with 'Venom' ( also played by -Him- , of course ) . . . . to some often tender, and occasionally even genuinely -Moving- banter, within the undeniably funny **""Love-quadrangle""** of Eddie and Venom , along with 'Anne Weying' and 'Dr. Dan Lewis' ( Michelle Wiilliams and Reid Scott, respectively ). 2 : Tom Hardy succeeds **-Phenomenally-** , in delivering his ""super-symbiotic"" performance ; with an -{ ABSOLUTE }- degree of credibility. How I wish more people would only appreciate how **( -Incredibly- )** difficult it is to emote for two -very- different entities, -near- simultaneously, that exist within just -{ ONE SINGLE }- body. 3 : Venom's ""Mardi-Gras Themed Nightclub Scene"". Simply stated, it's just absofreakinglutely -{ H I 💥 😂 - larious }. What's more, if you're a -passionate- progressive ( in real life ), like me, then you are almost -certain- to completely -{ Adore }- the 'horrible yet affable' Antihero's -equally- passionate appeal to stop ""Cruelty Against **ALIENS**"" . . . just a 'Glorious', ( albeit somewhat implicit ) message about the need to be -'Kinder'- to immigrants, documented or otherwise, delivered just -as- 'Gloriously' . . .

So here is perhaps -{ The }- most significant reason for -Why- that was the case, in my best estimation. Tom Hardy and Kelly Marcel, V2's storywriters . . . . -{ collectively }- lacked the requisite experience to rise to the indubitably -gargantuan- task of ( -Adequately- ) enthralling a whole -Planet- ; one that has now become -Altogether- used to watching 'PHENOMENALLY' entertaining Marvel fare, and there's really no other way to say it. Tom, ( whom I 'Admire To Death' as a -performer- , I definitely ought to point out here ), had only two✌ **-STORY-** writing credits to his name prior to V2 , with Kelly logging just three👌 . . . { counting 'Individual' TV Series, but -Not- counting 'Shorts' ( short films ), of course }. 3 : A "" MASSIVE "" Missed Opportunity : It is -indeed- not all that often that we see a quintessential 'Popcorn-blockbuster' flick make a -significant- effort to -Humanize- the villain by way of their -{ Early Childhood Experiences }- , no matter -how- evil they nay be shown as being.

**C "" FINAL SUMMARY "" :** I have absolutely -{ N O }- doubt in my mind that had V2 been roughly 'a good 23 minutes' longer ( -At Least- , in order to make for a more ""Marvel-like"" runtime of Two-full-hours ) ; that I would have given it a mimimum score of '8 out of 10', without a moment's thought. -That- , in addition of course, to my ""Titular-gripe"" . . .

"I liked it very much, so I add my top ten to the already existing positive reviews. The film is great in its genre. After the first viewing, it seemed to me that the second film would be stronger than the first. Duo Hardy-Harrelson = aerobatics. In the end, from the abundance of excellent jokes, my facial muscles ached (by the way, special thanks to the translators for the texts). I'm waiting for the continuation, it's very interesting to know what other capabilities Venom will demonstrate.",7,2021-11-17T08:28:40.190Z,Henry,unknown,580489,Venom: Let There Be Carnage,movie
"_Venom: Let There Be Carnage_ never tries to be anything other than a dumb superhero film, but if you hated the first film, the sequel won’t make you feel any differently about Marvel’s lethal protector.

Hardy, in dual roles, is what makes these films worthwhile in the slightest, as his intricately comical self-chemistry is insane. The film also boasts what feels like an accelerated pace that moves the story from action sequence to action sequence before coming to an end rather quickly, leaving _Venom: Let There Be Carnage_ to stand as one of those a special kind of stupid blockbuster endeavors that, every so often, strikes idiotic gold.

The sequel is a definite improvement over the first film in the sense that it totally embraces its stupidity resulting in a comic book film that feels light, silly, and amusingly psychotic all at the same time.

"Passably entertaining sequel that is better than the original though I found that one utterly bland. This one still has the issue of me checking out once you have a CGI character fighting another CGI character. However, the interaction between Brock and Venom was great and the effects work wasn't bad, though most of the time scenes were dimly lit. **3.25/5**",6,2021-12-29T20:13:44.313Z,JPV852,unknown,580489,Venom: Let There Be Carnage,movie
"I'm gonna give this Venom movie a not so great rating.  I still love the character.  Venom is the quintissential anti-hero.  Once a bad guy (though not in this universe apparently) he now tries to do the right thing while keeping within acceptable norms to exist among humans.  
This movie was a good attempt but, it came across as contrived and a bit cookie cutter as far as the bad guys, Woody Harrelson and Naomi Harris, were portrayed.  Psychoes enjoying newfound freedom after a fail death sentence, and lifelong incarceration is soooooo....bland.  In short, ""It's been done (before).""  

The story from there is hit 'n miss with comedy, plot, and tension.  The movie pretty much happens in that manner as well.  It jumps as if each of the scenes are little movies banded together with no smooth transitions : Hardy really needs to workout or pass the character to someone else; his age is showing.  Harrelson and Harris' characters really didn't mesh, the half deaf cop never really fit into the story, we didn't hear enough from Carnage, and Venom's night out didn't actually go anywhere.  

The vibe of the movie felt clunky.

I'll always like Venom.  But this was not particularly thrilling.  There is mixed opinion on which of the two movies is better.  I'll have to fall into the camp of those who liked the first Venom movie.  The second, more than not, simply let me down.  So, I will wait and see if another company can do better with the character than its predecessors.  3/5 stars.",5,2022-02-16T12:04:17.772Z,DallasBob,unknown,580489,Venom: Let There Be Carnage,movie
"I didn't get as much entertainment from this as I did with its predecessor. Still narrowly good enough, though.

<em>'Venom: Let There Be Carnage'</em> - great title, fwiw - does retain the fun performance from Tom Hardy, while the introductions of Stephen Graham, Woody Harrelson and Naomie Harris are welcomed ones in terms of the cast; even if I think their characters, particularly the latter two, are a little hit-and-miss throughout.

The action and the fact that the film only lasts for around 90 minutes mean I didn't have a negative time watching this; it is sillier this time out, which also helps. Could be a 6/10 film, but for me it inches itself into 7/10 territory.",5,2022-03-15T02:13:41.744Z,r96sk,unknown,580489,Venom: Let There Be Carnage,movie
"I was really looking forward to this. I enjoyed the first one and the trails for this sequel looked fun... What happened? It is all over the place. It starts off promisingly enough with an enjoyable set piece with ""Eddie"" (Tom Hardy) and Michelle Williams (""Anne"") - aided by some pithy one-liners from an unseen ""Venom"" but after we are introduced to ""Cletus"" (Woody Harrelson) the thing really hits the skids. The entertaining elements from the first film, the humour and - dare I say it, the symbiotic relationship/tolerance of man and amoeba are thrown under the bus for this angry CGI fest. Add to this pretty dry mix the rather pointless character of Harrelson's childhood sweetheart ""Frances"" (Naomie Harris) alias ""the Scream"" (remember the symbiotes don't like fire of sound), with her own agenda against copper ""Mulligan"" (Stephen Graham) and the whole thing just boils down to a very good looking film - but one with a plot that was almost non-existent, and that robbed the formidably sarcastic ""Venom"" of much of the charm that made the original work. Come to think on it - Hardy hardly features at all. I didn't hate it - it has a pace that passes 90 minutes effortlessly enough, but sorry, I was really disappointed.",5,2022-03-27T12:33:00.825Z,CinemaSerf,unknown,580489,Venom: Let There Be Carnage,movie
"Let me say this... It isn't a bad movie to watch at all.

Felt more like an after thought of the previous film than it's own film. It becomes messy trying to hear Venom cause he talks so fast. Carnage was bad ass... His love interest felt tacked on and cliche. Did we need Michelle Williams back? Not really. The ending... It set up a huge potential for a film I am sure fans would LOVE to see.",5,2022-07-26T08:19:10.004Z,Martha,unknown,580489,Venom: Let There Be Carnage,movie
"Spectacularly colourful with a sweet, (albeit predictable) path. Certainly not a misfire from Pixar, but also did not appeal to me personally in the way that many of their other films have.

"**Beautiful, colourful and sweet**

This film has real heart, with great messages about what family can and should do for each other.  Great voice acting, great songs without having the burden of exposition via song that you find in the more musical ventures by Disney.  I loved that you could see genuine guitar chords being played, so often in live action films the playing of musical instruments, especially guitar are poorly faked.  None of that in this animated gem.

One thing I personally loved was the depiction of Mexican culture.  Although I really enjoyed _Moana_, I thought it was a little bit too much of a pastiche of multiple Pacific cultures when it should have just picked one (Maori) and stuck with it.  _Coco_ celebrates Mexican culture, and depicts it well.  The only thing missing for me was more Mexican cuisine.

It can get a little dark in places, so maybe be careful when watching it with the little ones, but should appeal to most of the family.

"Sensational! <em>'Coco'</em> is straight into my top five of Disney animations.

The whole 105 minutes are a joy to watch, thanks to its rich and highly meaningful story alongside the wonderful animation and sharp humour. Safe to say, I was not expecting this film to smash it out the park - which it totally does. This is why I don't, personally, look up about films before watching them, I love being surprised.

Big credit also goes to the cast, who play some awesome characters. From Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez) to Héctor (Gael García Bernal) to Ernesto (Benjamin Bratt), among others, they are all very, very good.

It isn't just the characters that make this memorable, it is also the excellent plot which is told beautifully. It's filled with not just comedy but also a load of heart - there's a few nicely done twists too. The world that they create around the Day of the Dead is fantastic, while the music fits perfectly.

"Budding guitarist ""Miguel"" is puzzled by his family's long-established ban on anything musical. To him it just doesn't make any sense at all especially as, generations ago, his family were at the top of that very game. Determined to get to the bottom of that mystery so he can emulate the legendary heart-throb ""Ernesto"" (a cross between Julio Iglesias and Justin Bieber), he finds that serendipity takes an hand in things. On the Day of the Dead, he manages to get himself transported to the the vibrant and surprisingly lively land of the dead where he encounters the slightly mischievous ""Hector"" who promises to guide him to his great, great grand-father, find the truth and enable him to return home to a family that will, once again, embrace music. He has to get a move on though, as he only has the hours of darkness to fulfil his quest - so the race is on. Meantime some of his other, long deceased, family are also on his trail bent on returning him home without his music. To be honest, I found the underlying tale of loyalty and family to be just a bit overly-sentimental at times, but the quality and vivacity of the animation is a class apart - huge great eyes and smiles that tell the story so much better than words ever could. The story marries the musical with the dastardly and mysterious nicely with a well written script and a quickly paced storyline that is really quite entertaining. This works better on a big screen - it really shows the animators art off to best effect and, luckily, this has plenty for the adult audience too with some engagingly quirky characters.",6,2023-09-02T06:04:11.561Z,CinemaSerf,unknown,354912,Coco,movie
"Its nice to see Nicolas Cage in a film deserving of his talents. 

Arcadian is not an exceptional horror thriller but what it does do, is done competently enough to be deserving of praise. It has a serviceable story, that reminds me a little of ""A Quiet Place"" from 2018. The core premise is not quite the same but the monster effects are similar, as is the rural setting. 

The tension is ratcheted up nicely as the story progresses. As is always the case with what is essentially a survivalist horror, we know the creatures are going to get in but what happens next is, of course, the interesting part. Along the way we get to know the key characters, including Cages father figure. His effective absence part way through film and his return near the end, is a little disappointing but given this film has a coming of age component, its understandable. 

Acting is decent throughout and you can certainly relate to the plight of Cages little ad-hoc family. The creature effects work well enough too but somehow, they are just not all that creepy or especially menacing. This tends to rob the film of a real post apocalyptic horror vibe. I think revealing exactly what they are, early on, was a mistake too that took away any reveal/jump scare potential, from the film. 

All that said, Arcadian is in most respects a worthwhile watch that you should consider adding to your horror/thriller inventory. Definitely worth a look.",6,2024-05-02T04:19:24.404Z,MovieGuys,unknown,1051896,Arcadian,movie
"OK, so I know I shouldn't have, but I did quite enjoy this. There are some seriously menacing beasties about and so every night dad (Nicolas Cage) has to lock his two sons ""Joseph"" (Jaeden Martell) and ""Thomas"" (Maxwell Jenkins) and himself into their home and hope their fortifications hold until morning. No, I didn't say it was original, but it's quite well paced as the loved-up ""Thomas"" manages to get a bit too close to these nocturnal monsters which causes his father to get injured and requires ""Joseph"" - the brains of the family (who reminded me the entire time of Dan Radcliffe) to come up with some clever ruses to keep the whole lot of them alive. Cage barely features which is no bad thing here as the two boys and girlfriend ""Charlotte"" (Sadle Soverall) make a perfectly good job of keeping the thing moving along quickly and quite entertainingly for and hour and an half. The visual effects aren't the best, but the claustrophobic settings; the regular axe-wielding; a fair bit of burrowing and a the help of a chest freezer work fine. You'll never remember it, and quite what any of it has to do with Arcadia is anyone's guess, but for light and fluffy summer cinema, it works fine.",6,2024-06-20T16:24:03.746Z,CinemaSerf,unknown,1051896,Arcadian,movie
"As a long-time fan of Nic Cage, I went into Arcadian with high expectations. The trailer was intriguing, hinting at a familiar story with potential for new and exciting directions. However, the film felt like two different movies in one. While I enjoyed both aspects separately, they didn't blend well together.

The film starts with a grounded, realistic tone that sets up an engaging story. Nic Cage delivers a solid performance, immersing himself in a character that is both relatable and compelling. However, the narrative takes a sharp turn into absurdist territory, introducing elements that feel out of place in the established world. For example, the grounded scenes where Cage's character navigates personal challenges are suddenly juxtaposed with bizarre, otherworldly events that disrupt the film's coherence.

The grounded part of the story focuses on Cage's character dealing with real-world issues, offering a nuanced exploration of his psyche. This segment is filled with strong character development and emotional depth. In contrast, the absurdist elements, featuring creatures that seem to belong in a different genre, clash with the film's initial tone. 

While it's possible to successfully combine grounded and absurdist elements in a film, Arcadian struggles to achieve this balance. The creatures introduced do not fit seamlessly into the world we are shown, leaving many questions unanswered. The lack of cohesion between the two parts of the story makes it difficult for the audience to stay engaged. 

The film raises intriguing questions about the nature of reality and perception but fails to provide satisfying answers or connections between the disparate elements.

Despite its narrative shortcomings, Arcadian boasts solid acting and impressive cinematography. Nic Cage's performance is a highlight, bringing intensity and authenticity to his role. The cinematography enhances the film's atmosphere, capturing both the grounded and surreal elements with skill. 

Arcadian is a film with strong individual components that fail to coalesce into a unified whole. The acting and cinematography are commendable, but the disjointed narrative undermines the film's potential. To improve, a more seamless integration of the grounded and absurdist elements would be necessary, providing clearer connections and answers to the questions posed. Despite its flaws, the film offers moments of intrigue and is worth watching for fans of Nic Cage and experimental cinema.",6,2024-07-09T15:51:50.517Z,TheSceneSnobs,unknown,1051896,Arcadian,movie

""Azrael is characterized by the absence of dialogue and a dense visual narrative, challenging viewers to interpret every detail. E. L. Katz's direction, combined with Mart Taniel's captivating cinematography, creates a mysterious, immersive atmosphere, though it doesn't always balance the story's ambiguity with the need for emotional impact.

Nonetheless, Samara Weaving's magnetic performance is the true pillar that holds the movie together, making it a compelling experience with several memorable moments of horror and violence, even if some of its more abstract elements may frustrate part of the audience.

**Full review:** https://bit.ly/Grupid",7,2024-07-03T00:53:29.806Z,Chris Sawin,unknown,519182,Despicable Me 4,movie
"There are so many movies within the Despicable Me franchise that I've lost count of all the storylines in each. While I've never been a big fan of these movies, they at least always felt exciting. However, this fourth installment in the Gru storyline is little more than a dud. The silliness and excitement are there for younger audiences, but the film lacks heart.

One of the main problems with the Despicable Me movies is the tendency to pile on more characters just to add celebrity voices to the cast. This fourth movie is no exception. While the addition of new characters can sometimes breathe fresh life into a franchise, here it feels like a missed opportunity to develop a more heartfelt story. For instance, the introduction of a new, younger female character named Poppy as a heist partner for Gru could have been a chance to add depth. However, it might have been more impactful to see Gru partnering with his oldest daughter, who is now a teenager. This would have added a layer of connection and growth between Gru and his daughter, showcasing his evolving role as a father.

The film also introduces a subplot where some Minions are turned into a superhero team, only to be used in the movie for less than 10 minutes. This subplot feels like a wasted narrative thread that could have added excitement and depth to the story. Additionally, one of the main Minions, Ralph, is stuck on a vending machine for the entirety of the movie, reducing his role to a mere gag. This sidelining of key characters in favor of introducing new ones dilutes the emotional core that could have made the story more engaging. 

While my son enjoyed the movie, which makes sense for his age range, it’s important for these films to also entertain the parents who are watching with their children. The earlier movies in the franchise managed to strike a balance between humor for kids and clever moments for adults. This installment, however, feels more like a series of gags strung together rather than a cohesive story with emotional weight.

If there are more films in the Despicable Me series, I believe it’s time to hang it up. However, if the franchise continues, I will wait for streaming to watch them because I am not interested in seeing them in theaters. The magic that made the original films entertaining for a broad audience seems to have faded, and without a significant shift in storytelling, future installments are likely to feel just as lackluster.",6,2024-07-09T14:24:00.700Z,TheSceneSnobs,unknown,519182,Despicable Me 4,movie
"If it's not sacrilegious to say, I think this franchise is starting to run out of steam - the plot here isn't very original. The family ""Gru"" have a new child who doesn't much take to his father which only makes matters worse when arch-nemesis ""Maxime Le Mal"" - who is intent on turning everyone into cockroaches - escapes from custody bent on revenge on the man who put him in jail in the first place. Better safe than sorry, ""Silas"" relocates the family to a safe house where they have to pretend to fit in with the vacuous tennis club set, but one of that number - the feisty ""Poppy"" knows the secret and blackmails ""Gru"" into helping her pinch ""Lenny"" the badger from under the eyes of the diminutive ""Principal Übelschlecht"" at his alma mater. This adventure narks the headmistress and when she sees some video of the perpetrators, she's straight on to the phone with ""Maxime"" who hatches a plan to steal the baby and give him wings! The minions - and the newly formed and enhanced ""Super Minions"" - still manage to have some fun here as they discover their new home has a vending machine and an endless supply of popcorn, and there is some wit in the dialogue but the story itself is all pretty derivative and the animation looks a little too tired now. What was ground-breaking looks so much less now and the writing and characterisations are nothing special anymore. It does liven up for the last ten minutes, but the previously innovative and enjoyable mix of menace and mayhem has largely gone.",6,2024-07-16T07:48:57.825Z,CinemaSerf,unknown,519182,Despicable Me 4,movie
"The goofy Minions are on the loose again in “Despicable Me 4,” a lazy sequel that does little more to advance the franchise other than embodying the old adage of “style over substance” to a fault. There is very little here to recommend other than the first class technical achievements (the visuals are stunning, and the direction is better than expected for an animated film), making this installment feel more like a mindless baby sitter rather than a thoughtful exercise in creativity and storytelling.

Former supervillian Gru (voice of Steve Carell) is living the good life with his wife Lucy (voice of Kristen Wiig), his daughters Margo (voice of Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (voice of Dana Gaier), and Agnes (voice of Madison Skyy Polan), and new baby Gru Jr., who proves to be a handful for his daddy. Their peaceful routine is sent into chaos when the evil Maxime Le Mal (voice of Will Ferrell) and his girlfriend Valentina (voice of Sofía Vergara) escape from prison and set their sights on a new nemesis and potential target: Gru. This forces the family to go on the run and assume new identities in the suburbs.

The plot is basic and sounds like it could be a lot of fun with its fish out of water spin. Unfortunately, very little is done with the story. The film bounces back and forth with a lame narrative and cute Minions taking part in a variety of wacky, screwball antics, which may provide a good balance for adults and kids, but nothing about any of it works well. The far too simple and sparse story meanders between uninspired plot points and predictable characters arcs, never quite finding its footing. In other words, the movie is just plain dumb.

The introduction of the Mega Minions is mildly fun and entertaining, but it runs out of steam fast (I fear these characters are going to spin off into what will inevitably be another lackluster film). Everything else is a shallow gimmick as the movie struggles to maintain momentum. At least it’s true to the “Despicable Me” canon, but the film also shows that there’s only so much you can do with these characters and this universe. Move along: there’s nothing original to see here.

"The goofy Minions are on the loose again in “Despicable Me 4,” a lazy sequel that does little more to advance the franchise other than embodying the old adage of “style over substance” to a fault. There is very little here to recommend other than the first class technical achievements (the visuals are stunning, and the direction is better than expected for an animated film), making this installment feel more like a mindless baby sitter rather than a thoughtful exercise in creativity and storytelling.

Former supervillian Gru (voice of Steve Carell) is living the good life with his wife Lucy (voice of Kristen Wiig), his daughters Margo (voice of Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (voice of Dana Gaier), and Agnes (voice of Madison Skyy Polan), and new baby Gru Jr., who proves to be a handful for his daddy. Their peaceful routine is sent into chaos when the evil Maxime Le Mal (voice of Will Ferrell) and his girlfriend Valentina (voice of Sofía Vergara) escape from prison and set their sights on a new nemesis and potential target: Gru. This forces the family to go on the run and assume new identities in the suburbs.

The plot is basic and sounds like it could be a lot of fun with its fish out of water spin. Unfortunately, very little is done with the story. The film bounces back and forth with a lame narrative and cute Minions taking part in a variety of wacky, screwball antics, which may provide a good balance for adults and kids, but nothing about any of it works well. The far too simple and sparse story meanders between uninspired plot points and predictable characters arcs, never quite finding its footing. In other words, the movie is just plain dumb.

The introduction of the Mega Minions is mildly fun and entertaining, but it runs out of steam fast (I fear these characters are going to spin off into what will inevitably be another lackluster film). Everything else is a shallow gimmick as the movie struggles to maintain momentum. At least it’s true to the “Despicable Me” canon, but the film also shows that there’s only so much you can do with these characters and this universe. Move along: there’s nothing original to see here.

“Despicable Me 4” is a lazy movie overall, which is a shame because the technical aspects are so excellent.

"Felt like it wasn't sure what its own film was trying to accomplish at all. 
One minute we're watching gru back in the AVL capturing another infamous villain thats known gru since high school. Only for him to escape and supposedly hunting gru back down in revenge.. which takes only the whole movie to find him.

No joke, its like waiting for Bart or Vector to go after gru but never finding any result till the last 10 minutes. Its a VERY BORING movie. Yes its for children but the first two films I felt like both adults and kids could enjoy it. 

Even the minions were meh in this, I usually have some chuckles if not with gru and his kids/family. They felt phoned in as well. Maybe its about time we stop making these yeah?

On a side note gru has a kid who can clearly understand english which tells me hes at least 2-3. Yet his adopted children are still the exact same age? This only works in television cartoon shows I feel like, especially when time has progressed since gru and lucy have been married. Either have the girls grow up too or don't have a baby in the film as if time skipped.",5,2024-08-12T02:16:07.845Z,UWotMatez,unknown,519182,Despicable Me 4,movie

"Terrifier is a gory movie with a sadistic killer clown that revels in mutilating his victims in creative ways and willing to use any kind of improvised weapon as well as one not often seen in slasher movies. The movie makes effective use of practical effects and the gory murders are graphic enough to make you know this movie means business. David Howard Thornton stars as Art the Clown and his portrayal is devilishly effective as a villain who is mute and must use facial gestures to express himself in his ghoulish clown makeup. The story is the usual cat and mouse variety but this film is more about watching Art capture, torture and mutilate his victims. Terrifier is an effective and bloody slasher film that follows the usual formula of 1980's horror films and has crowned Art the Clown as one of the new faces of horror.",5,2019-07-21T22:02:10.366Z,Carlos G Diaz,unknown,420634,Terrifier,movie
"_Terrifier_ had a lot of hype behind it with its very successful sequel hitting theaters this month, and unfortunately it did not translate to a pleasurable viewing experience. Before I jump into my criticisms of the film, the on-screen quality of visuals and effects were top notch for a budget of a mere $25,000. It is amazing what this crew was able to do with their conditions and everyone involved should be proud. With that being said, the limited budget does not give excuses for a poor script, dialogue and performances. This movie had a tremendous amount of cringe with perverted dialogue that seemed as if a middle schooler wrote it. The performances were campy, but not in a good way. In classic horror films the camp has a sense of nostalgia and a sign of the times but with this modern film with kills and elements that are taking themselves somewhat seriously, it just comes off as bad. The actor behind Art did do a fantastic job though. His portrayal of a mute killer who communicates to his victims with mimes and clown tricks was funny and chilling at the same time. The plot on its face did not have much depth to it. It boiled down to people in the wrong place at the wrong time. There was no added depth or lore to why these events were happening, although I did enjoy how each character who was tragically murdered had a connection the plot and were not just some random people introduced and killed in a single scene just to pad the kill count. As horror film, this movie failed to add any stakes or tension. The director leaned more into the gore which can be unsettling to look at but never made me feel uneasy. There was no build up to any of the kills, these classic horror elements made the movie seem extremely bland. Overall, I think this film is a marvel from a technical perspective based on its low budget, but when judging it from a film perspective it left me bored and waiting for the credits.

"""Tara"" (Jenna Kanell) and best pal ""Dawn"" (Catherine Corcoran) have had a bit too much to drink to drive when they encounter a rather melancholy looking clown. The latter woman makes some snide remarks before both revert to a pizza place to try and sober up. Guess who comes in? So far it's all a bit benign, but when the girls return to their car to discover a flat tyre and ""Tara"" desperate for a pee, a nearby building proves tempting for it's plumbing - but of course it's not what it appears nor is our rather sad friend anywhere near done with his (or her) evening's work. As slasher's go, this is actually quite fun and there's a bit of menace aided well by the paucity of dialogue from our calculating antagonist. Sadly, though, that cannot be extended into the characterisations of the two women who just annoyed pretty much from the get go. Loud, obnoxious and capable of some of the most stupid decisions ever committed to celluloid. Things get even more preposterous when sister ""Victoria"" (Samantha Scaffidi) turns up to collect the stranded pair and proves to be even more dumb than her sibling when it comes to risk taking and wandering about a derelict old building at night - all whilst the radio has been relaying warnings of a marauding slasher about town. It's mercifully short, which does help keep the pace tight but the acting from those with speaking parts is pretty woeful, as it the writing that gives them their lines - and by the end, I was very, very, much in the corner of a baddie who ought to have been left to get on with the job!",5,2024-09-28T08:39:11.014Z,CinemaSerf,unknown,420634,Terrifier,movie
"Terrifier proves you don’t need a big budget to make a movie — just $35,000, a bucket of fake blood, and a clown with the worst dentist in town.",4,2024-10-15T14:15:56.540Z,griggs79,unknown,420634,Terrifier,movie
"<em>'Terrifier'</em> is a mixed bag.

The gory stuff is done to a decent degree, even if those moments are a bit too few and far between. Art the Clown certainly looks and acts the part, even if I wanted more from the character - giving him a voice would've made him more creepy in my opinion, rather than complete silence.

This 2016 flick was made on a tiny budget, something that is very evident throughout, but given that you do have to hold appreciation for the filmmakers. I will say, though, that the level of acting is iffy and the dialogue is rather terrible, at least for the most part. The former is understandable given the aforementioned, though the latter is a negative.

I am anticipating better from <em>'Terrifier 2'</em> and <em>'Terrifier 3'</em>, given the presumption of a larger budget and all that comes with that. I still respect this original attempt, but I personally wouldn't class it as anything that is strongly worth watching.",5,2024-10-24T12:54:18.973Z,r96sk,unknown,420634,Terrifier,movie

"As a fan of “Lost,” I was intrigued when I heard that some of the same people were involved in the new EPIX series “From.” Unfortunately, the show doesn’t live up to the expectations set by “Lost.” While it starts off incredibly promising and has a unique feel, the lazy writing and subpar acting hold it back as the season progresses.

The unforgiving gore and genuine horror element that the show first offers are among its most distinctive features, but even these begin to wear thin as the season progresses. By the time I finished the first season, I couldn’t help but feel underwhelmed.

Although a second season is in the works, “From” barely does enough to keep me returning for more. I would probably tell my past self not to watch it if I could go back in time.

Even though I’m drawn in by the mystery, I’m worried about the show’s future. The writing is reminiscent of J.J. Abrams; the writers are adding mysteries at whim with no idea how to resolve them. Intriguing at first, but the poor writing soon began to sour the experience.

If you enjoy mysteries, you might want to give “From” a shot, but be aware that it features subpar acting and a superfluous plot that will make you lament the wasted opportunities. It’s far from bad, but it’s also not particularly noteworthy given the calibre of television we’ve been spoilt by in 2022.

"A solid 10/10 series from a storytelling perspective. Honestly, the trailer didn't attract me that much, but I decided to give it a chance, and after the first 3 episodes, I couldn't stay away from this show. What fascinated me the most was the people behind this series because the story is exceptional; I found myself deeply engaged with the characters, trying to find an escape route along with them. I quickly finished the first two seasons, and now I have to wait for season 3, but I can't wait for it to come out. I have an idea of how the next season could be based on the ending of season 2, but my mind is not as brilliant as the minds of the people who created this show. If you enjoy series that make you think and deliver a guaranteed outcome for you, only to completely change the situation and leave you in suspense and mystery, then this is a great show to watch.",6,2023-07-23T23:10:03.955Z,Alex,unknown,124364,FROM,tv

"I have to confess I stumbled across this, quite by chance. I don't watch a lot of US entertainment these days. I did however, grow up watching my share of Stallone action films, so a dash of nostalgia and curiosity, drew me in. 

There's nothing terribly original by now about the plot of Tulsa King. Its  Mafia style antics are noting new. I think it was a smart move, playing this as a dark comedy. It fits the well worn character, Stallone, inhabits. 

That said, I guess the key question is, is it entertaining? I'd say ""sort of"". I like seeing Stallone back on the small screen. Regrettably, thus far and I appreciate its early days, the story is a little basic. Even for a comedy, it stretches credulity at times and lacks an intelligent wit and charm, that would have rendered it, more appealing. 

In summary, Stallone's star power will probably draw people in but will viewers keep watching? Unless it ups the stakes, by crafting a more witty, clever tale of a long in tooth mobster, I for one, have my reservations.",6,2022-11-14T21:14:35.733Z,MovieGuys,unknown,153312,Tulsa King,tv
